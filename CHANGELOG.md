and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-18

### Added
- **`vipmp_server_info`** tool — diagnostic dump: package version,
  Python version, index age + counts (endpoints / errors / schemas /
  releases / deprecations), sitemap size, cache stats, log file path,
  and a "Tips" section pointing at the right tool when something looks
  off. First call when debugging.
- **`Literal` types for closed-set arguments** — `section` on
  `list_vipmp_releases`, `method` on `describe_vipmp_endpoint`, and
  `language` on `generate_vipmp_request` are now declared as `Literal[...]`.
  Surfaces in the tool's JSON schema as `enum: [...]`, so MCP clients
  can render them as dropdowns (and reject invalid values before they
  reach the server).

### Changed
- **Sharper error messages** across `server.py` and `validator.py` —
  empty-result paths and fetch failures now tell the caller exactly
  what to do next. Examples:
  - `get_vipmp_page` fetch failure → suggests `refresh_vipmp_sitemap` /
    `list_vipmp_docs` and explains the retry behaviour.
  - "No error codes matched query" → suggests dropping the filter,
    using a substring, or rebuilding the index.
  - "No request schema extracted" → suggests `get_vipmp_page` and
    `get_vipmp_code_examples` for the same path.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md release checklist** — added a "refresh dev
  dependencies" step (`pip install -e ".[dev]" --upgrade`) before
  pre-tag lint, so future hotfixes like v0.4.1 don't recur from local
  / CI ruff drift.

### Considered, deferred
- **Structured output** for `validate_vipmp_request` — FastMCP supports
  it via TypedDict return types, but adopting it would replace the
  current Markdown output with auto-generated text (less readable for
  humans). Will revisit if any agent integration explicitly needs
  programmatic issue lists.
- **Prompt argument completion** — MCP spec scopes
  `completion/complete` to prompts and resource templates, not tool
  args. Our prompts currently don't have closed-set arguments worth
  completing.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- CI lint failures on ruff 0.15 that didn't fire on the older ruff
  version pinned locally. Addressed by:
  - Replacing a trivial `if`/`else`-block with a `value or fallback`
    expression in `codegen.py` (SIM108).
  - Combining nested `with patch(...):` statements in
    `tests/test_codegen.py` (SIM117).
  - Prefixing an unused unpacked variable with `_` in
    `tests/test_validator.py` (RUF059).
  - Re-sorting import blocks in both new test files (I001).

### Changed
- **Pinned `ruff>=0.15.0,<0.16`** in the dev extras so local and CI see
  the same rule set. Avoids the kind of surprise where a working local
  pre-commit run passes but CI fails on newly-enabled rules.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-18

### Added
- **`describe_vipmp_endpoint(method, path)`** — one-shot endpoint profile:
  returns the request schema, documented error codes, release-note
  mentions, and cross-references to code examples + validation in a
  single call. Replaces 4 chained tool invocations with one coherent
  view. Index-backed; closed-world.
- **`validate_vipmp_request(endpoint, body_json)`** — programmatic
  validator that cross-checks a JSON body against the documented schema.
  Detects unknown fields (warning), missing required fields (error),
  type mismatches (error), constraint violations like "Max: 35 characters"
  or numeric maxes (error), nested objects not recursively validated
  (info), and usage of deprecated fields (warning). Turns the
  `review_request_body` prompt workflow into a real programmatic tool.
- **`generate_vipmp_request(endpoint, body?, language?)`** — emits a
  runnable code snippet for an endpoint in one of four languages:
  `curl` (default), `powershell` (Invoke-RestMethod), `python` (httpx),
  `csharp` (HttpClient). When no body is supplied, builds a placeholder
  body from the schema so the snippet shows the full shape the developer
  needs to fill in. Skips read-only fields automatically.
- **Deprecation tracking** — extractors now scan for deprecation markers
  ("deprecated", "will be removed", "no longer supported", "sunset",
  "end of life") and tag endpoints and schema fields with a
  `deprecated: bool` + `deprecation_note: str | None`. Used by
  `describe_vipmp_endpoint` (flags deprecated endpoints with a banner)
  and `validate_vipmp_request` (warns when a deprecated field is used).

### Changed
- **Index schema bumped to v3.** Adds `deprecated` + `deprecation_note`
  to `Endpoint`; adds `deprecated` to `SchemaField`. Any on-disk index
  from v0.3.x is transparently discarded and rebuilt.
- **Server instructions** rewritten to guide Claude toward the new
  endpoint-centric tools before falling back to generic doc search.
- **Code snippet placeholder body** now includes all non-read-only
  fields when no field is explicitly required (Adobe's docs don't always
  mark required fields), so developers see the full shape instead of
  an empty body.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-04-18

### Added
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — you're reading it.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — dev-environment setup, test/lint workflow, PR guidelines.
- **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`** — Contributor Covenant 2.1.
- **Test coverage reporting** via `pytest-cov`. Coverage runs in CI and an XML
  report is uploaded as a workflow artifact.
- **`examples/`** directory — runnable Python scripts demonstrating how to
  talk to the server programmatically via the MCP client SDK (useful for
  CI, automation, and non-Claude consumers).
- **README badges** — CI status, Python versions, license, MCP protocol.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-04-18

### Added
- **MCP tool annotations** on all 13 tools: `title`, `readOnlyHint`,
  `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint`. Lets well-behaved
  clients auto-approve read-only calls and confirm before destructive ones,
  and satisfies the Anthropic Connectors Directory submission requirements.

### Changed
- Each tool now carries a human-readable `title` distinct from its
  programmatic name.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-18

### Added
- **First-class release-notes tracking** — new `list_vipmp_releases(since, section, limit)`
  tool serving dated, structured entries from Adobe's release notes. Three
  sections tracked separately: `api_changes` (production API), `sandbox`
  (Sandbox environment-specific), `upcoming`.
- **Pre-built structured index** shipped with the package
  (`src/vipmp_docs_mcp/data/index.json`). Structured tools now answer in
  single-digit milliseconds instead of re-parsing HTML on every call.
- **`rebuild_vipmp_index` tool** — rebuild the index locally from live
  Adobe docs (~60s).
- **Two new MCP Prompts** — `summarize_recent_changes(since, area)` and
  `check_feature_status(feature)`, both release-aware.
- **Daily `refresh-index.yml` GitHub Action** — rebuilds the shipped
  baseline from live Adobe docs and opens a PR on structural change.
  Unchanged days produce nothing.
- **Weekly `link-check.yml` GitHub Action** — validates every sitemap
  path resolves and opens an issue on 404s.
- **Structured extractors**: `list_vipmp_endpoints`, `list_vipmp_error_codes`,
  `get_vipmp_schema`, `get_vipmp_code_examples` — all index-backed.
- **Content-aware search** — `search_vipmp_docs` now ranks on cached
  page content in addition to title/tag matches; search results use
  section- or paragraph-level truncation instead of blunt character cutoffs.
- **Disk-backed cache** with 24-hour TTL and `If-None-Match` / ETag
  revalidation. Stale entries are revalidated cheaply; 304 responses
  just bump the timestamp.
- **Auto-sitemap** from Adobe's published `/sitemap.xml`. Handles their
  path migration (underscores → hyphens) that was causing ~60 404s on
  the old hand-curated sitemap.
- **`refresh_vipmp_sitemap` tool** — rebuild the sitemap from Adobe's
  published sitemap.
- **Tenacity-based HTTP retries** with exponential backoff for transient
  5xx / 429 / timeouts.
- **Trailing-slash fallback** in the fetcher — Adobe's docs site is
  inconsistent (some paths 200 only without trailing slash, others only
  with). The fetcher transparently tries both.
- **Content sanity check** — requests that don't contain the expected
  markers (login walls, CDN errors) fail loud instead of returning garbage.
- **`warm_vipmp_cache` tool** — pre-fetch every sitemap page so content
  search has strong recall on all pages.
- **`vipmp_cache_stats` / `vipmp_cache_clear` tools** — operational
  introspection and invalidation.
- **78-test pytest suite** with mocked `httpx`. Runs in under 3 seconds.
- **End-to-end smoke test** (`scripts/smoke_test.py`) over real MCP
  stdio transport.
- **Structured file logging** to a rotating log file in the user's cache
  directory.
- **`pyproject.toml` + hatchling build** replacing `requirements.txt`.
  Adds `uvx`-installable console script entry point (`vipmp-docs-mcp`).
- **CI workflow** — lint + tests on Python 3.12 and 3.13 matrix.
- **Apache 2.0 license** + `NOTICE` file with Adobe trademark disclaimer.

### Changed
- **Restructured** from a single-file `server.py` into a proper Python
  package (`src/vipmp_docs_mcp/`). Every module is independently testable.
- Path normalization now canonicalizes to no-trailing-slash (was
  trailing-slash-required). Fetcher retries the opposite variant on 404
  so existing consumers aren't affected.
- `search_vipmp_docs` output — section-relevance-ranked instead of
  first-6000-chars.

### Removed
- `get_vipmp_releases()` — replaced by the richer `list_vipmp_releases`
  (date + section filterable, served from index).
- Hand-curated `SITEMAP` as primary source — now used only as a fallback
  when the persisted auto-generated sitemap is missing.

### Fixed
- ~60 404s caused by Adobe's underscore-to-hyphen path migration.
- `<br />` tags encoded as literal text (`&lt;br /&gt;`) in Adobe's
  table cells are now parsed into line breaks.
